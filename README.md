This repository contains a template Obsidian vault for academic note-taking. It contains some demo files and has some useful community plugins installed and configured.

#### Purpose of the vault

The **purpose of this vault** is to help you get started with Obsidian and some of the (in our view) useful plugins for academic notetaking. You can use this vault as a starting point to customize you own academic vault. 
The vault is pre-configured and set up to
- Organize tasks in your projects 
- Organize your days and weeks with automatic note templates that collect all the tasks and meetings that are happening today
- Set up meetings and create automatic meeting notes
- Connect your Zotero database, extract Zotero notes and manage and collect literature notes in your vault
- ...
The vault contains some detailed readme file that help you learn about the vault and that point you to more in-depth information about Obsidian and customized Obsidian setups.

#### Get started

To get started with the vault you need to do the following:

1. Download and install Obsidian for your machine from [here](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Download this notebook_demo from the newest release on Github
3. Unzip the notebook_demo and save it at a convenient location on your machine
4. Rename the folder that contains the notebook_demo if you want
5. Start Obsidian, click on `Open folder as vault` and select the (maybe renamed) notebook_demo. Obsidian will open the notebook_demo as vault for you
6. While opening a warning will pop up asking for permission to enable plugins that the vault contains. They are necessary to have the full functionality of the vault.  Here, you can read more about the plugin security policy of Obsidian: [here](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Plugin+security)
