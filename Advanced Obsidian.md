### Linking and embedding 

Remember, you can link notes within your Obsidian Vault by using `[[]]`. For example, I can link to an example note from the Project folder like this: [[example]]
You can also link to specific headings or section within notes by using a "#" or a "^" like this: [[example#Heading 1.2]] or [[example#^73a7bc]]

By setting an exclamation mark in front of the brackets `![[]]`, , you can embedd a file or a subsection of the file. Here is an example: 
![[example#Heading 1.2]]

- [ ] Explain the backlinks and outgoing links section

You can even embedd youtube videos or websites within a note. See a tutorial here: https://patrickberry.medium.com/embed-youtube-video-in-obsidian-efc6f78e35e6
