## Folder structure
This vault comes with predefined folders for academic purpose. However, every personal workflow is different. Therefore, we see this as a suggestionto start with, not a mandatory structure. 
The predefined Folders are:
- **1_Journal**: Here is the place for regular Labbook-style files

	- **Weekly**: If you create a weekly file (for exaple via the [[Get Started - Vault#Calendar]]) it will be stored here.
