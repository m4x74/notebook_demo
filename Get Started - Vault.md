## Folder structure
This vault comes with predefined folders for academic purpose. However, every personal workflow is different. Therefore, we see this as a suggestionto start with, not a mandatory structure. 
The predefined folders are:
- **1_Journal**: Here is the place for regular Labbook-style files
	- **Daily**: If you create a daily file (for example via the [[Get Started - Vault#Calendar]]) it will be stored here.
	- **Weekly**: If you create a weekly file (for example via the [[Get Started - Vault#Calendar]]) it will be stored here.
- **2_Projects**: This is the place for organising and storing files of your projects
- **Templates**: In this folder you can find the templates which are used to create the daily and weekly files

## Installed community plugins and what they do

### Calendar

Adds the little calendar on the left. The calendar shows you which day has open tasks (little dot on the day). Also, you can click on a specific day or a specific week. Then you can automatically create a daily or weekly note for the day/week according to your template. 

Works well together with: [[Get Started - Vault#Periodic notes|Periodic notes]], [[Get Started - Vault#Templater|Templater]]

### Dataview
Treat yourÂ Vault as a database which you can query from. Provides a JavaScript API and  
pipeline-based query language for filtering, sorting, and extracting data from Markdown pages. 
It is used within the Daily and Weekly files, e.g. [[2022-W51#ðŸŒ´ Daily log files of the week]]

### Emoji shortcodes
Insert emojis in your text using the shortcodes. E.g. `:purple_heart:` for ðŸ’œ or `:see_no_evil:` for ðŸ™ˆ

### Minimal Theme Settings

### Periodic notes
With this plugin you can easily create and navigate between daily and weekly files (also monthly, quaterly or annual files are possible). 
In the settings you can link a plugin and set the specific folder, where the new file will be created. 

### Tasks
The plugin helps to track tasks within your complete vault. Where ever you format any text like this 
``- [ ] task``
It will be recogniced as task. 

Moreover, you can also date the tasks. If you ad a "due to"-date (by clicking in the drop down menu or ... ), the task will appear in the daily log file of the selected day. Here is an example of an open task and a fulfilled task (just click to change the state): 
- [ ] Describe what "tasks" are ðŸ“… 2022-12-21 
- [x] Describe what done tasks are ðŸ“… 2022-12-22 âœ… 2022-12-22

### Templater
Templater is necessary for the used templates.
