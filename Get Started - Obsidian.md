Welcome to your Obsidian Notebook. ðŸŽ‰

This is a basic template that helps you get started with using Obsidian to manage your notes and tasks. In the following, you find information on what was set up using communitiy plugins and obsidian settings. 

For more information and inspiration on what you can do with Obsidian check out the following tutorial by Nicole van der Hoeven:

# Obsidian basics

## Markdown

Obsidian uses Markdown to format the the text of your notes. 
But as soon as you are finished typing, Obsidian will not show you the markdown syntax anymore but will show you the formatted text. If you click on a formatted element, you will see the markdown version of it. You can try it by clicking on the heading of this section and you will see that there is a `##` in front of the header text.

This is the most basic Markdown syntax:

```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

**bold**
*italic*
_italic_

[A Link](https://google.com)

- list
- list
- list

1. numbered list
2. numbered list

- [ ] A task
```

To make text bold or italic, you can also use the keyboard shortcuts you are used to from other programs (Ctrl + B/I on Windows). Have a look at the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to find more option to format text in Markdown.

## Linking Files

You can link notes within your Obsidian Vault by using `[[]]`. For example, I can link to an example note from the Project folder like this: [[A note in project A]]
You can learn how to embed files and how to link to specific sections in the [[Next level - Obsidian]] File. 

## Tags
Another way to link files is by using Tags like #tag written as `#tag` .

## Navigating Obsidian

In the figure below, you find some important sections of the Obsidian window and what you can do there. But in general: Just experiment and click on the buttons to find out what they do.

## Settings

Check out yourself which settings you can change for your Obsidian vault. Just click on the gear icon in the bottom left to see what you can do.
Settings can be changed for general Obsidian things (Appearance, Hotkeys, ...) and for the core and community plugins.

## Hotkeys 
You can customize all hotkeys in the Obsidian settings. 
Some very essential ones (for my workflow) are: 
- `Ctrl/Cmd + O` : Open quick switcher to open and search for files.
- `Ctrl/Cmd + P` : Open command palette to access commands within Obsidian.
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F` : Search in all files of Obsidian. 
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + T` : Edit Tasks. 
- `Alt + E` : Select and insert template in note

## The graph view

The graph view shows you how the files in your vault are linked with each other. For this template vault, the graph looks like this:

![[Pasted image 20221223105640.png]]

You can open the graph view with the Hotkey `Ctrl/Cmd + G` or by clicking on the graph icon in the toolbar on the left (5th from the top). You can also filter your graph by tags or group them. Just explore what you can do.

## Canvas
Canvas is an Obsidian core plugin.

> Canvas allows you to organize notes visually â€” an infinite space to research, brainstorm, diagram and lay out your ideas.

You can embed your notes alongside images, PDFs, videos, audio, and even fully interactive web pages. 
You find an example in this vault: [[brainstorming.canvas|brainstorming]]
