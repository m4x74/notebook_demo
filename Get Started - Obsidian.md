# Obsidian basics

## Markdown

Obsidian uses Markdown to format the the text of your notes. 
But as soon as you are finished typing, Obsidian will not show you the markdown syntax anymore but will show you the formatted text. If you click on a formatted element, you will see the markdown version of it. You can try it by clicking on the heading of this section and you will see that there is a `##` in front of the header text.

This is the most basic Markdown syntax:

```md
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

**bold**
*italic*
_italic_

[A Link](https://google.com)

- list
- list
- list

1. numbered list
2. numbered list

- [ ] A task
```

To make text bold or italic, you can also use the keyboard shortcuts you are used to from other programs: Ctrl + B/I on Windows. Have a look at the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to find more option to format text in Markdown.

## Linking  Files

You can link notes within your Obsidian Vault by using `[[]]`. For example, I can link to an example note from the Project folder like this: [[example]]
You can learn how to embed files and how to link to specific sections within the [[Advanced Obsidian]] File.
